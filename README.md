# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Fabian Lukassen  
ðŸŽ“ M.Sc. Applied Statistics | ðŸ§  Machine Learning & AI | ðŸ’» Software Engineering

I'm passionate about applying statistical thinking and machine learning to solve real-world problems.  
Currently, I'm exploring the intersection of **interpretability and generative AI** in my master's thesis at **BASF**, and developing a **Python package for ensemble-based changepoint detection**.

## ðŸ’¼ About My Work

The repositories below represent a selection of my public work. Much of my professional code remains proprietary and cannot be shared. Many projects were originally hosted on [GitLab (GWDG)](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/fabian.lukassen ) and some have since been migrated here. Some earlier work has been lost to old laptops, servers, and Raspberry Pis over the years â€” such is life I guess.
